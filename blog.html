        <h2>My journey on becoming a software engineer.</h2>
        <p>
          After several months of learning Front-End Web Development, I've made
          big strides towards creating projects, reviewing code and meet
          like-minded people along the way.

          <h3>How I say commited to learning</h3>
          <p>
            How I stay committed to learning I like to think of myself as a
            lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try
            to create simple projects using what I learned or work new
            techniques into existing projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I
            was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
          </p>
          <h3>How I got started</h3>
          <p>
            How I got started I started simple and gradually grew my learning
            journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After
            each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what
            I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my
            own words.
          </p>
          <p id="lastPara">
            That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting
            my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
            motivated.
